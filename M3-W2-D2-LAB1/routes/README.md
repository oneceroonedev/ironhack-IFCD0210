Create your own REACT project containing:

- A Home component, which displays a presentation of the website. It must be located in the "/home" and "/" paths.

- A component used to display the playlist you created previously. It must be located in "/songs".

Extra:

- A 404 error component. If the path is not found, this component must appear.

Remember that applying CSS is not mandatory, but I highly recommend it.
