Create your own REACT project containing:

- A JSON file with songs you like (5 songs)

Each song must have:

    {

    title: String,

    album: String,

    albumImage: String (url)

    duration: integer,

    rating: integer

    }

- A component that displays the list of songs

- A component that displays information about your hobbies

Remember that applying CSS is not mandatory, but I highly recommend it.
